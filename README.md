# China-s-Iron-and-Steel-Industry-Decarbonization-Model

This repository provides a **spatially- and temporally-explicit integrated framework** linking material flow, cost, and technology adoption to assess **provincial decarbonization pathways** for Chinaâ€™s iron and steel industry.  

## Features
- Tracks material flows across provinces and time periods  
- Integrates cost analysis with technology adoption pathways  
- Generates reproducible figures and datasets for scenario analysis  

## Repository Structure
- **Process_xx.py**  
  Scripts for data processing and generation. Each script corresponds to a specific dataset.  
- **Figx_xx.py**  
  Scripts for figure plotting. Each script reproduces the figures in the analysis.
